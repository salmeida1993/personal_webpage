An initial take on my personal webpage

Author: Stewart Almeida

Class: https://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_spring_2019/

Project Object: The project objective consists of a few elements:
Create a functional personal webpage that consists of my own interests, skills, background, related projects, etc. in a responsive manner using HTML5, CSS3, and JS.
Add 2 additional pages - 1 of my own choosing regarding content and 1 made entirely from an AI prompt (Claude)
Include some aspect of functionality through JS that is unique - consists of more than 5 lines

The website consists of 3 pages total, developed using standard HTML5, CSS3 in conjunction with Bootstrap for additional framework tools, and JS ES6 modules. A navigation bar at the top links to other sections of the main page and to the additional pages as needed. Links to additional sites, such as a personal GitHub, LinkedIn, and uploaded Resume, are also provided.

Main unique feature included through JS is a button that will automatically return the user to the very top of the page, visible only after the user has scrolled down some distance value.

AI page was generated using the following prompts via Claude:

Picture yourself as a novice web developer tasked with creating a webpage. The main webpage, including the CSS and JS files, are already created and can be used as a reference/baseline to work off of. The main webpage consists of an about me section, some skills and interests, a projects section, and a contact me section. Create a separate HTML page I can append to this existing project that conveys my skills in a robust manner. Skills include: Leadership, teamwork, personnel management, project management, time management, Python, C programming language, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Create a visually appealing page. Use the attached HTML, CSS , and JS files as a template and baseline for your design. Use Bootstrap as you see fit for additional CSS implementation. Provide me a completed HTML file and note any additions that must be made to the CSS and JS file.

Second prompt to note a minor spelling adjustment:

Please keep the title of this HTML as "ai.html" and update the code as needed

Final prompt to attempt to address an undue change to the dropdown menu:

The tab under "Extra" will remain as "Ai", not "Skills".
